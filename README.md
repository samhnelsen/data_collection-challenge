# data_collection-challenge

In this challenge, I built on the web scraping and data analysis skills I've learned to:

1. Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles. This can be found in the Jupyter notebook called part_1_mars_news.ipynb

2. Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table. This can be found in the Jupyter notebook called part_2_mars_weather.ipynb. I also exported a csv of the data I collected called mars_data.csv
